A large Language Model may have billions of parameters. It is difficult to finetune such large models. However, with the QLoRA technique, which utilizes quantization and PEFT. We can finetune an LLM to a specific task. 

In this notebook, we finetune the Bloom-3b model to generate Lord of the Ring-like texts. Which can be trained on Google Colab with free T4 GPU.
